[This is Work In Progress github]

This GitHub contains files which authors are the Quansheng devs, Darek SP4UBW, Egzumer, Joaqim, guys from the Quansheng telegram group and some edits by me like adding new font, enabling usefull stuff which original authors disabled (flash light, FM radio, DTMF calling) and making original txt file and it`s translation of readme describing what Darek SP4UBW .bin file contains.

All files are made for universal use of radios. For now we have K5, K6 (which is described as 5(8)) and 5R+ which are basically the same radios but with some details like different backlight color LED, lack of USB type C (5R+ only) and different face plate.
